=== Emacs Ports

Contact: Emacs Ports Team <emacs@FreeBSD.org>

The Emacs development port, editors/emacs-devel, continues to be updated twice per month to synchronize with the HEAD of upstream's master branch.
A noteworthy change from the first June 2021 update was the addition of a NATIVECOMP port option [1].
NATIVECOMP adds support for compiling Emacs lisp to native code using libgccjit, which was first enabled in lang/gcc11-devel [2] and is now in lang/gcc11.

For more information about native compilation of Emacs lisp, see link:https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GccEmacs.
