This report covers FreeBSD related projects for the period between April and July, and is the second of four planned reports for 2021.

Some of this reports highlights include but are not limited to work on an experimental installer, changes to pf, additional work on the Linuxulator, updates on the state of kernel sanitizers, coverage of the raidz expansion feature for ZFS, and some news about resource accounting.

Yours, +
Daniel Ebdrup Jensen, with status hat on.
