=== Enable ASLR by default for 64-bit executables

Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) is an exploit mitigation
technique implemented in the majority of modern operating systems.
It involves randomly positioning the base address of an executable
and the position of libraries, heap, and stack, in a process's address
space. Although over the years ASLR proved to not guarantee full OS
security on its own, this mechanism can make exploitation more difficult.

Semihalf team made an effort to toggle the kernel settings of all 64-bit
architectures to use address map randomization for PIE (Position Independent
Executables) & non-PIE 64-bit binaries. The
https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/commit/?id=b014e0f15bc73d80e[patch] was merged to HEAD.

TODO:
* Improve stackgap feature implementation.
* MFC to stable/13 branch.
