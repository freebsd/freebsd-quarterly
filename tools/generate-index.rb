Many projects build upon FreeBSD or incorporate components of FreeBSD into their
project. As these projects may be of interest to the broader FreeBSD community,
we sometimes include brief updates submitted by these projects in our quarterly
report. The FreeBSD project makes no representation as to the accuracy or
veracity of any claims in these submissions.

Objects that defy categorization.
