Semihalf has recently started work on FreeBSD support for BCM5871X SoC series.

Link: [BCM58712 Product Brief](https://www.broadcom.com/products/embedded-and-networking-processors/communications/bcm58712/)

These are quad-core 64-bit ARMv8 Cortex-A57 communication processors targeted for
networking applications such as 10G routers, gateways, control plane processing and NAS. Initial support will include iProc PCIe, internal BNXT Ethernet
controller, OTP (One Time Programmable memory)
and crypto engine acceleration for IPsec offloading. This work is expected to be ready for FreeBSD-HEAD before Q3 2019.
