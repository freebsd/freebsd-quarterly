FreeBSD provides the Ports Collection to allow a simple way for users and
administrators to install applications.

It is possible to configure a port before the building and installation,
PortConfig is an utility for setting the port options via a Text User Interface,
it and its dependecies (libbsddialog and libncurses) are released completely
under permissive open source licenses. Currently the dialog4ports TUI utility
performs this task, unfortunately it depends on non-permissive software.

As each terminal has different properties PortConfig can be custimized via
environment variables to set up the User Interface, for example: menu size,
theme, borders, and so on, each feature is documented inside the manual.
Further, if a port has a specific 'pkg-help' file, PortConfig will show a Help
button to open a "popup" with help information.

FreeBSD provides thousands of ports therefore it is not feasible to test
PortConfig for each use, please report any problem.

I would like to thank Baptiste Daroussin for the port, suggestions, help, and
testing for this utility and its library.
