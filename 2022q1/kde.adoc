The KDE on FreeBSD project packages the software from the KDE Community, along with dependencies and related software, for the FreeBSD ports tree.
The software includes a full desktop environment called KDE Plasma (for both X11 and Wayland) and hundreds of applications that can be used on any FreeBSD machine.

The KDE team (kde@) is part of desktop@ and x11@ as well, building the software stack to make FreeBSD beautiful and usable as a daily-driver graphics-based desktop machine.

*KDE Qt Patch Collection* The Qt Company stopped releasing Qt 5.15 updates under Open Source licenses in 2020. Qt 6 is now released under an Open Source license, but for the world of Open Source software that requires Qt 5, there is still a need for updates. The KDE Community fills that need by maintaining a curated set of patches -- generally backported from Qt6 -- to maintain the Open Source version of Qt 5. FreeBSD ports now use this *KDE Qt Patch Collection*, rather than the outdated last Qt 5.15.2 release from the Qt Company.
