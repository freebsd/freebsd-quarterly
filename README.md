FreeBSD Quarterly Status Reports
================================

This is the working repo for FreeBSD Quarterly Status Reports.
To submit your own report:

1. Fork the repository.  Reusing an old fork is fine
2. Go into the directory for the current time period: `2019q3`
3. Create a new file, with name corresponding to the
   name of your project.  Please use the `report-sample.md`
   as a template.
4. Create a Pull Request

Please submit your reports as early as you can.  You can tweak
your report afterwards; just edit it and submit another PR.

Don't worry too much about the Markdown syntax or language errors - we
will fix it for you.

Deadline for submitting Status Reports for the fourth quarter of 2019
is 2020-01-01.  (Note that this is immediately after the end of the fourth
quater, not several weeks later as was the case with previous quarterly
reports.)
