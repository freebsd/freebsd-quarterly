IRC Admin

The FreeBSD IRC Admin team manages the FreeBSD Project's presence and activity on the freenode IRC network, looking after:

    Registration and management of channels within the official namespace (#freebsd*).
    Channel moderation.
    Liaising with freenode staff.
    Allocating freebsd/* hostmask cloaks for users.
    General user support relating to channel management   

While the FreeBSD Project does not ''currently'' endorse IRC as an official support channel [1][2], as it has not been able to guarantee a consistent or positive user experience, IRC Admin has been working toward creating a high quality experience, by standardising channel administration and moderation expectations, and ensuring the projects ability to manage all channels within its namespace. 

In the last quarter, IRC Admin:

 - Cleaned up (deregistered) registrations for channels that were defunct, stale, out of date, or had founders that were inactive (not seen for > 1 year). Channels that were found to be otherwise active have been retained. FreeBSD now has ~40 channels registered from a previous total of over 150.

 - Documented baseline configuration settings in the Wiki for channels, including ChanServ settings, channel modes, registration policy, etc.
 
 - Established multiple documented methods for reporting user abuse or other channel issues to IRC Admin for resolution
 
Upcoming changes:

 - Work with existing #freebsd* channels to standardise channel management, settings and access.
 
 - Migrate, forward and/or consolidate existing or duplicate #freebsd* channels to channels with a standard naming convention.
 
 - Work with unofficial ##freebsd* channels to migrate them official #freebsd* channels if suitable
 
 - Update existing IRC-related website and documentation sources the describe the official state of project managed IRC presence on freenode.

Lastly, and to repeat a previous call, while the vast majority of the broader user community interacts on the freenode IRC network, the FreeBSD developer presence still needs to be significantly improved on freenode.

There are many opportunities to be had by increasing the amount and quality of interaction between FreeBSD users and developers, both in terms of developers keeping their finger on the pulse of the community and in encouraging and cultivating greater contributions to the Project over the long term.

It is critical to have a strong developer presence amongst users, and IRC Admin would like again to call on all developers to join the FreeBSD freenode channels to increase that presence.

Users are invited to /join #freebsd-irc on the freenode IRC network if they have questions, ideas, constructive criticism, and feedback on how the FreeBSD Project can improve the service and experience it provides to the community on IRC.
