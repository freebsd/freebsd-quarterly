The Semihalf team initiated working on FreeBSD support for the
[NXP LS1046A SoC](https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-based-processors-and-mcus/qoriq-layerscape-arm-processors/qoriq-layerscape-1046a-and-1026a-multicore-communications-processors:LS1046A)

LS1046A are quad-core 64-bit ARMv8 Cortex-A72 processors with
integrated packet processing acceleration and high speed peripherals
including 10 Gb Ethernet, PCIe 3.0, SATA 3.0 and USB 3.0 for a wide
range of networking, storage, security and industrial applications.

Already completed:
   * Platform base support (ramp-up multi-user SMP operation with UART)
   * SATA 3.0

In progress:
   * USB3.0
   * SD/MMC
   * I2C

Todo:
   * Ethernet support
   * GPIO
   * QSPI
   * Upstreaming of developed features. This work is expected to
     be submitted/merged to HEAD in the Q4 of 2019.
