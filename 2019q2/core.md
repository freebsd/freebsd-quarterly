## FreeBSD Core Team ##

Contact: FreeBSD Core Team <core@FreeBSD.org>

The FreeBSD Core Team is the governing body of FreeBSD.

- Core approved source commit bits for Doug Moore (dougm), Chuck Silvers
  (chs), Brandon Bergren (bdragon), and a vendor commit bit for Scott
  Phillips (scottph).

- The annual developer survey closed on 2019-04-02.  Of the 397
  developers, 243 took the survey with an average completion time of 12
  minutes.  The public survey closed on 2019-05-13.  It was taken by
  3637 users and had a 79% completion rate.
  [A presentation of the survey results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nc8N6GtAPg&t=549)
  took place at BSDCan 2019.

- The core team voted to appoint a working group to explore
  transitioning our source code 'source of truth' from Subversion to
  Git.  Core asked Ed Maste to chair the group as Ed has been
  researching this topic for some time.  For example, Ed gave
  [a MeetBSD 2018 talk on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8wQ88d85s4).
  
  There is a variety of viewpoints within core regarding where and how
  to host a Git repository, however core feels that Git is the prudent
  path forward.

- The project received many Season of Docs submissions and picked a top
  candidate.  Google will announce the accepted technical writer
  projects on 2019-08-06.  We are hoping for lots of new and refreshed
  man pages.
