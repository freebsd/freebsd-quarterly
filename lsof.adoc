sysutils/lsof in ports has had a major upgrade to no longer go looking 
in /dev/kmem for data and using the userland API.  This has taken a long
time to hit the tree, but is finally done.  This fixes lsof(1) to work with
ZFS again for the first time since 13.0-RELEASE.

This will make the maintenance of sysutils/lsof much easier going forward.

To the kernel folks: if you make changes that break lsof, please submit a 
github PR to https://github.com/lsof-org/lsof. Please test any changes to
the interfaces that lsof uses and make sure they still work.  These all should
be userland interfaces now, but please test. 

My thanks to Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>, Mateusz Guzik <mjg@FreeBSD.org>,
and Ed Maste <emaste@FreeBSD.org> for help getting this major change landed.
