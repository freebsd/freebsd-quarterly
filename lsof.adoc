sysutils/lsof in ports has had a major upgrade to no longer go looking 
in /dev/kmem for data and using userspace API's.  This has taken a long
time to hit the tree, but is finally done.  This fixes lsof(1) to work with
ZFS again for the first time since 13.0-RELEASE.

My thanks to Warner Losh <imp@FreeBSD.org>, Mateusz Guzik <mjg@FreeBSD.org>,
and Ed Maste <emaste@FreeBSD.org> for help getting this major change landed.
