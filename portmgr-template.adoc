The Ports Management Team is responsible for overseeing the overall direction of the Ports Tree, building packages (through its subsidiary pkgmgr), and personnel matters.
Below is what happened in the last quarter.

* commit bits granted/safekept (who/why)
* portmgr news/members
* infra: USES, default-versions, big changes
* major port updates (pkg), Firefox, Chromium
* exp-runs, pkg-builders, other infra

If help is needed, make this explicit.
List tasks, with enough detail that people know if they are likely to be able to do them, and invite people to get in contact:

* Help for PRs?
* Help for testing?
* Help for documentation?
