Status reports are not just about telling everyone that things were done, they also need to explain why they were done.

The Ports Management Team is responsible for overseeing the overall direction of the Ports Tree, building packages, and
personnel matters.
Below is what happened in the last quarter.

If help is needed, make this explicit.
List tasks, with enough detail that people know if they are likely to be able to do them, and invite people to get in contact:

* Help for PRs?
* Help for testing?
* Help for documentation?
