Contact: Ka Ho Ng <khng@FreeBSD.org>

This work presents a number of ioctl commands on [.underline]#/dev/sndstat# using nv(9) to expose all available audio device nodes.
nv(9) is used to generate a serialized binary stream representation of the information of audio device nodes presented in the running system.
The documented nvlist structure in sndstat(4) manual page is stable for programming use.

For a long time, enumerating the audio device node interface required parsing content of [.underline]#/dev/sndstat#.
It is tedious to write such a parser and handle different `hw.snd.verbose` levels correctly.
Using nv(9) eliminates the need to write a text parser to do audio device nodes enumeration.

This work has been committed and is available in FreeBSD 14-CURRENT.
