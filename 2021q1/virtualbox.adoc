The VirtualBox ports have been updated to upstream 6.1.18 release.

This is a new major release with new feature and better support, especially for graphics output. 
This new release has support only for recent amd64 CPUs providing virtualization support in hardware (VT-x, AMD-V bits).

The previous version of the VirtualBox ports have been preserved as -legacy version to allow people unable to use the new version to have a virtualization solution.

The new additions port at present fails to build on i386 but the old additions do provide basic functionality for such emulation.
