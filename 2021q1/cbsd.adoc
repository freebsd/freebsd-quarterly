### What is CBSD? ##

CBSD is a management layer written for the FreeBSD [jail(8)](https://man.freebsd.org/jail/8) subsystem, [bhyve(8)](https://man.freebsd.org/bhyve/8) and [xen(4)](https://man.freebsd.org/xen/4)xen(4).
CBSD allows users to manage jail/bhyve/xen environments at different levels of abstraction by providing a varied number of unified methods: vagrant-like `CBSDfiles`, `CLI` and via [dialog(1)](https://man.freebsd.org/dialog/1).

### CBSD 2021Q1 Status Report ###

RestAPI service layer was added during last quarter, enabling creation of programmable cloud solutions.
In addition, work has been done to support RestAPI through a `CBSDfile`, allowing for private cloud environments deployment.
In such cases the local CBSD layer acts as a thin client.
