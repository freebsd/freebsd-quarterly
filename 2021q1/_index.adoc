== Third-Party Projects

Many projects build upon FreeBSD or incorporate components of FreeBSD into their project.
As these projects may be of interest to the broader FreeBSD community, we sometimes include brief updates submitted by these projects in our quarterly report.
The FreeBSD project makes no representation as to the accuracy or veracity of any claims in these submissions.
