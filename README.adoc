= FreeBSD Quarterly Status Reports

== Drafts

This repository is for drafts.

Please submit your draft as early as possible. To submit:

1. Fork the repository - reusing an old fork is OK.
2. Create a new branch and enter the directory for the current time
   period - `2022q2`.
3. Create a new file, with a name that corresponds with the name of
   your project - use the `report-sample.adoc` template.
4. Create a pull request.
5. Someone will review it and may request changes. If they do,
   evaluate the requests, make any you think are warranted, explain
   any you chose not to, and push again. *Do not squash or
   force-push* if at all possible as this makes the next review
   much harder.
6. Once your draft is accepted and merged, you're good.

You can tweak things after your draft was merged. Simply edit, then
submit another PR.

Please do not worry excessively about language errors or AsciiDoc
syntax - we can correct things for you.
