## Upstreaming NetApp Changes ##

NetApp has started an effort to upstream bug fixes and other improvements from
the ONTAP code line into FreeBSD. These changes benefit the FreeBSD
community by providing many fixes that NetApp has made over the past few years,
while allowing NetApp to reduce the number of customizations needed when
bringing in the latest FreeBSD changes back into the ONTAP tree.

NetApp has partnered with Klara to facilitate this project, to help identify
interesting and useful changes to send upstream, to rework and generalize those
changes as required to make them suitable for upstreaming, and to shepherd them
through the FreeBSD code review process.

During the fourth quarter, Klara has made 40 upstream fixes in the FreeBSD
kernel in various subsystems including geom, dev, amd64, net, kern, netinet, and
several other areas of the tree on behalf of NetApp.

NetApp intends to continue to sponsor this effort throughout 2021.
