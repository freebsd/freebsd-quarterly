The Doc New Generation project it's finished. The cutover will be in the Saturday, January 23rd.

The objective of using Hugo and AsciiDoctor is to reduce the
learning curve and let people to start quickly with our documentation
system. Other benefits of using Hugo is that we can use other
technologies aside from AsciiDoctor, like MarkDown, RST, Pandoc, etc.

You can find a work in progress FreeBSD Documentation Project Primer update to reflect the Hugo/AsciiDoctor link:[here](https://github.com/sergio-carlavilla/documentation-project-primer)
